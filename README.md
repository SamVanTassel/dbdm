# DBDM

DBDM is a simple 4-track drum machine whose patterns are stored on a database.

It stores up to eight 16-step patterns, assigning each one a name. As more patterns are saved to a track, that pattern's name is displayed below your track. The names of your tracks combine to create a four-word identifier for your track.

## tone.js

Currently, DBDM only writes and displays patterns and does not play them back. Implementing features from the tone.js library to turn the pattern display into a working drum machine is the next goal for this project.
